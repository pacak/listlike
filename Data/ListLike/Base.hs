    ListLike full item | full -> item where

    ------------------------------ Creation
    {- | The empty list -}
    empty :: full
    empty = mempty

    {- | Creates a single-itement list out of an itement -}
    singleton :: item -> full

    ------------------------------ Basic Functions

    {- | Like (:) for lists: adds an itement to the beginning of a list -}
    cons :: item -> full -> full
    cons item l = append (singleton item) l

    {- | Adds an itement to the *end* of a 'ListLike'. -}
    snoc :: full -> item -> full
    snoc l item = append l (singleton item)

    {- | Combines two lists.  Like (++). -}
    append :: full -> full -> full 
    append = mappend

    {- | Extracts the first itement of a 'ListLike'. -}
    head :: full -> item

    {- | Extracts the last itement of a 'ListLike'. -}

    {- | All elements of the list except the last one.  See also 'inits'. -}

    ------------------------------ List Transformations

    {- | Apply a function to each element, returning any other
         valid 'ListLike'.  'rigidMap' will always be at least
         as fast, if not faster, than this function and is recommended

    {- | Like 'map', but without the possibility of changing the type of
       the item.  This can have performance benefits for things such as
       ByteStrings, since it will let the ByteString use its native
       low-level map implementation. -}
